"""
In the last exercise, you saw how to move data from Spark to pandas. However, maybe you want to go the other direction, and put a pandas DataFrame into a Spark cluster! The SparkSession class has a method for this as well.

The .createDataFrame() method takes a pandas DataFrame and returns a Spark DataFrame.

The output of this method is stored locally, not in the SparkSession catalog. This means that you can use all the Spark DataFrame methods on it, but you can't access the data in other contexts.

For example, a SQL query (using the .sql() method) that references your DataFrame will throw an error. To access the data in this way, you have to save it as a temporary table.

You can do this using the .createTempView() Spark DataFrame method, which takes as its only argument the name of the temporary table you'd like to register. This method registers the DataFrame as a table in the catalog, but as this table is temporary, it can only be accessed from the specific SparkSession used to create the Spark DataFrame.

There is also the method .createOrReplaceTempView(). This safely creates a new temporary table if nothing was there before, or updates an existing table if one was already defined. You'll use this method to avoid running into problems with duplicate tables.

Check out the diagram to see all the different ways your Spark data structures interact with each other.

# Create pd_temp
pd_temp = pd.DataFrame(np.random.random(10))

# Create spark_temp from pd_temp
spark_temp = spark.createDataFrame(pd_temp)

# Examine the tables in the catalog
print(spark.catalog.listTables())

# Add spark_temp to the catalog
spark_temp.createOrReplaceTempView("temp")

# Examine the tables in the catalog again
print(spark.catalog.listTables())


"""Dropping the middle man
Now you know how to put data into Spark via pandas, but you're probably wondering why deal with pandas at all? Wouldn't it be easier to just read a text file straight into Spark? Of course it would!

Luckily, your SparkSession has a .read attribute which has several methods for reading different data sources into Spark DataFrames. Using these you can create a DataFrame from a .csv file just like with regular pandas DataFrames!

The variable file_path is a string with the path to the file airports.csv. This file contains information about different airports all over the world.

A SparkSession named spark is available in your workspace."""


# Don't change this file path
file_path = "/usr/local/share/datasets/airports.csv"

# Read in the airports data
airports = spark.read.csv(file_path, header=True)

# Show the data
airports.show()

"""Let's look at performing column-wise operations. In Spark you can do this using the .withColumn() method, which takes two arguments. First, a string with the name of your new column, and second the new column itself.

The new column must be an object of class Column. Creating one of these is as easy as extracting a column from your DataFrame using df.colName.

Updating a Spark DataFrame is somewhat different than working in pandas because the Spark DataFrame is immutable. This means that it can't be changed, and so columns can't be updated in place.

Thus, all these methods return a new DataFrame. To overwrite the original DataFrame you must reassign the returned DataFrame using the method like so:

df = df.withColumn("newCol", df.oldCol + 1)
The above code creates a DataFrame with the same columns as df plus a new column, newCol, where every entry is equal to the corresponding entry from oldCol, plus one.

To overwrite an existing column, just pass the name of the column as the first argument!

Remember, a SparkSession called spark is already in your workspace."""
